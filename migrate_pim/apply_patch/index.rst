How to apply a patch?
=====================

We frequently release patches for all supported versions - you can find the list of supported versions in this article
`How many PIM Enterprise Edition versions are maintained by Akeneo? <https://www.akeneo.com/fr/knowledge-base/how-many-pim-versions-are-maintained-by-akeneo/>`_

Each patch contains bug fixes and sometimes improvements or security fixes, **that is why it is very important to always have the latest patch installed on your PIM.**
